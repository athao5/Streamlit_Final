# Global Shark Attack Streamlit App

### Introduction
The Global Shark Attack Streamlit App is an interactive tool that allows users to explore shark attack data globally. This app is a transition from a Tableau dashboard, providing an easy-to-use interface for analyzing trends, victim demographics, attack types, and geographical patterns. With Streamlit, users can dynamically filter and visualize data in real time, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

### Data/Operation Abstraction Design
Data
The dataset includes details on shark attacks, such as attack type, location, victim demographics, time of occurrence, and shark species involved. Visualizations like heatmaps, bar charts, and time-series plots allow users to analyze attack frequency, victim profiles, and regional patterns.

### Operation Abstraction
The app is divided into three main sections:

Home Page: Overview and key insights.
Shark Species: Trends related to shark species involved in attacks.
Victim Demographics: Insights into the age, gender, and occupation of victims.
Users can filter the data through interactive widgets (sliders, dropdowns, etc.) to explore the dataset based on their interests.

### Future Work
Future improvements could include adding environmental data (e.g., water temperature), advanced filters, predictive analytics, and mobile optimization. Additionally, user profiles and custom data analysis options could enhance the appâ€™s interactivity. These updates will make the app even more useful for researchers and the public alike.
